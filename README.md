# Project: EcoPlanner
Authors: Ershey Waqar, Vanessa Lu, Raima Hoque

EcoPlanner is a Geographic Information System developed for the ECE297 software design project, aimed at providing an intuitive platform for environmentally conscious commuters. Created using C++ and Git, EcoPlanner incorporates A* algorithm routing with OpenStreetMap Database APIs and features a user-friendly interface rendered through the GTK and EZGL graphics libraries.

# Path Finding: A* Implementation
The A* Algorithm was employed to identify the most efficient path between two intersections. Users can either enter street names into the search bar or click directly on the map to select their intersections.

Once the intersections are chosen, the optimal route is visually highlighted on the map, and a pop-up provides detailed navigation directions.

Below is an example of a route generated by entering intersections via the search bar:
